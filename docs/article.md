# Article
The information parsed from a website are stored in a format we call `article`. The `article` itself is in `json` format. The contents of an `article` are the following:

First the contents that auto generated by the `saffron`:
```
{
  "id": "",        // string
  "hash": "",      // string
  "timestamp": 0   // number
}
```

`id`: is used to identify each article. It starts with the prefix `art` and following by a dash and a random alphanumeric string.

`hash`: like the `id`, it is used to identify the articles and it is generated using the following code:
```
(hash(`${this.title} ${this.content} ${this.extras?.toString()} ${this.getSource().getId()}`)).toString()
```
but on the contrary it used to compare the article contents so it will not be saved twice. This method is not fullproof, because if an article is edited then it is treated as a new article. There is also the possibillity to change the way where the has is generated  by using an [extension](http://saffron.poiw.org/en/extensions#article-hash).

`timestamp`: is the date where the article was scrapped from the `parsers`. The timestamp format is in milliseconds.

Next we have the contents that are scraped from the websites:
```

  "title": "",
  "content": "",
  "link": "",
  "pubDate": "",
  "attachments": [],
  "categories": [],
  "extras": {}

```
```
"title": is the actual title of the article that is parsed from the desired website.

"content": contains all the content of the article. This field is stripped from any type of `html code`.

"link": is the link of the article itself. If it is paste on a browser it will redirect you to the actual article.

"pubDate": is the date where the article was published. The date is in milliseconds format.

"attachments": is an array containing all the links offered from the article.

"categories": is an array of the categories where the article is stored.

"extras": in this field are stored all the extra information that are not belong to the other fields. Fields like `categories` where the `article` belongs or the `links` the are embed are the content of the article like pdf files or redirect links.

Finally
```jsx
{
  "source": {
  	"id": "",  // string
    "name": "" // string
  },
}
```

`source`: is an object that contains information that links the article with source file that was used to scrape itself from the specified website. You can call the function `getSource()` from an article to access the parsed object of the source file.
