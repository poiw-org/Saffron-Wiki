We recommend a specific order for using the available parsers.

**First**

If the desired website is based an [`WordPress`](https://wordpress.com/) and the WordPress Posts API is enabled, then choose the `wordpress` parser.

**Second**

If the desired website supports [`RSS`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed. then choose the `rss` parser.

**Third**

If the desired website has a structured form, the use the `html` parser.

**Fourth**

If none of the above is possible then the `dynamic` parser is our last choice.
