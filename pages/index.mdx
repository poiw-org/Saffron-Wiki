# Introduction
**Saffron | News & announcements aggregation framework**

The project is maintained by po/iw (ποιώ), a Greek university team that supports Free/Libre and Open Source Software and hardware.<br/>
Saffron was built to help teams collect and compile huge lists of aggregated news and announcement content intuitively and efficiently.<br/><br/>

### Architecture

Saffron's architecture is based on a `main` node that issues scraping instructions and several `worker` nodes that do the scraping & upload the data to the database.<br/>

The communication between the nodes is happening through the `Grid`. By using a `socket.io` implementation and in app encryption system, the communication is end to end safe.<br/><br/>

### Installation

**To use saffron, you will need to import it from a separate NodeJS App.**

To install it, use:
`npm i @poiw-org/saffron` or - if you are fancy: `yarn add @poiw-org/saffron`.<br/>

Then, you can import it using:
```
// ES6
import saffron from "@poiw/saffron"

// ES5
const saffron = require("@poiw/saffron")
```
Finally, initialize saffron using:
```
// Write your desired configuration in a `saffron.json` 
// file and save it in your project's root folder.
await saffron.initialize()

// or declare a path that points to your configuration file
await saffron.initialize("path/to/config.json")

// or pass a JSON object directly
await saffron.initialize({ ... })
```
